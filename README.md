# My Streamdeck Setup.

This is still very much in development, but i'd like to use my Elgato Streamdeck
more effectively with my typical (non-streamer) work.

## Progress Notes

### Button Actions
* To toggle mute in Google Meet:
    `xdotool search -name "Meet *" key ctrl+d`
    * There's also a way to do this with obs-websockets, If I'm using the obs virtual cam.

## Misc
